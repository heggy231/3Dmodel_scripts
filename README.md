## About the NIH 3D Print Exchange

[The NIH 3D Print Exchange](http://3dprint.nih.gov) is an online portal dedicated to providing data and tools for 3D printing and visualization of bioscientific and medical models. Files in the open-source, community-driven database are free to download, and in formats that are readily compatible with 3D printers. Users will also find a unique set of tools to create their own 3D-printable models from raw scientific and medical data. In an online sea of 3D-printable gadgets and widgets, the NIH brand empowers both researchers and educators with a trusted source to discover high-quality, accurate, and informative biomedical models for use in research, communication, and education.

The Exchange is owned and maintained by the Office of Cyber Infrastructure and Computational Biology of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Initial funding and support were provided by the HHS IDEA Lab at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
